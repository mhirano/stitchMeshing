## Abstract

We introduce the first fully automatic pipeline to convert arbitrary 3D shapes into knit models. Our pipeline is based on a global parametrization remeshing pipeline to produce an isotropic quad-dominant mesh aligned with a 2-RoSy field. The knitting directions over the surface are determined using a set of custom topological operations and a two-step global optimization that minimizes the number of irregularities. The resulting mesh is converted into a valid stitch mesh that represents the knit model. The yarn curves are generated from the stitch mesh and the final yarn geometry is computed using a yarn-level relaxation process. Thus, we produce topologically valid models that can be used with a yarn-level simulation. We validate our algorithm by automatically generating knit models from complex 3D shapes and processing over a hundred models with various shapes without any user input or parameter tuning. We also demonstrate applications of our approach for custom knit model generation using fabrication via 3D printing.

## Installation
- Clone the repository into your local machine:

- Compile the code using CmakeGUI 

You need to install [Gurobi](http://www.gurobi.com/) before compiling the code.

- Set include directory and lib directory accordingly for gurobi in CMakeLists.txt line 110 and 114.

- Use CmakeGUI with the correct directory for source code and build.

Note that the CMakeLists.txt is only tested with Visual Studio 2015.

## Usage

1. Open stitch-meshing.exe in build/release
2. **Open mesh** and choose your model
